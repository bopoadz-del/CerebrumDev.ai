"""Factory inventory declaration: what the Store actually stocks.

The writer can only be honest about domain depth where the Store carries
domain content. Which kit serves a vertical, and whether the operator declared
it ready to build against, are facts the Store's kit manifests state about
themselves (``serves_verticals``, ``build_ready``) -- read here through
``store_kits``, never copied into a Factory table. A copy goes stale; a kit
the Store ships must not read as missing because the Factory's list predates
it. Everything not declared ready gets an honest inventory note on the draft --
never a silent fabrication of domain authority (live-factory lesson: a
veterinary-clinic draft carried 8 REUSE capabilities against generic plumbing
with zero domain content).
