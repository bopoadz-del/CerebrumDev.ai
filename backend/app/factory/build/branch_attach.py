"""Resume a build from its cerebrum-builds branch, pasted into the Floor.

The branch IS the build: every run pushes its tree to
``build/sess_<id>-<suffix>`` on cerebrum-builds. Pasting that link (or the
bare ``sess_<id>``) re-attaches the tree as the workspace and continues at the
first phase not yet passed -- never re-running COLLECTOR, CLONER or WRITER
while the branch proves them done.

Phase state comes from the branch itself. The build ledger is Factory-internal
and never ships, so a clean checkout carries none; the tree is the evidence:
handlers in ``app/actions/``, a suite in ``tests/`` and the compiled
``docs/blueprint`` together mean COLLECTOR, CLONER and WRITER finished.

The local attach workspace is keyed by the branch's head sha. Pasting the same
link again while the head has not moved re-enters that workspace and its
ledger, so a run killed mid-TESTER resumes at TESTER -- not from the branch
evidence again, and never earlier.
