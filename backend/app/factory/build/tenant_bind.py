"""Phase 1 tenant-store binding for the build worker (option B).

Per-tenant SQLite file + per-tenant Chroma collection. The handle is
resolved from the AUTHENTICATED tenant identity at connection time —
never a client-supplied name — and the store root is a server-derived
digest of that identity, so one tenant's connection cannot address
another tenant's file. This module is the factory-side binding: the
generated platform ships its own ``app/steward/tenant_store.py`` seam
that the same identity digest drives.

The headless worker (codewhale_worker.run_worker_job) refuses an unbound
job before the CLI binary is even looked up; the runner seeds the bound
handle into the role state here.
