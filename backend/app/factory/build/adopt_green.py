"""Adopt a build branch that already passed the Store gate.

Audit of cerebrum-builds, 2026-09-19: several sessions had a ``build/<session>-*``
branch that was green in Docker while the Factory called the session failed
or stalled -- the verdict had been collected for nobody. Resuming such a
session used to mean rebuilding from scratch a platform that had already
passed.

The trap: the customer's zip is cut from the LOCAL workspace, while the gate
verified the BRANCH's tree. A later failed run may have rewritten the
workspace. Stamping "passed" on files the gate never saw would be a lie, so a
branch is adopted only when every product file it carries is byte-identical
(git blob sha) to the workspace. Otherwise nothing is adopted and the caller
falls through to the normal resume.
