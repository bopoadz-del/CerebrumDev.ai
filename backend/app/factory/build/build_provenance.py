"""Where a build's provenance values come from.

``docs/provenance/provenance.json`` and product-dna carry ``factory_commit``
and ``blocks_commit`` so a delivered pilot can be traced back to the exact
Factory and the exact Store that produced it. Both were written as
``"unknown"``: ``converge`` read them out of ``ctx.state``, and nothing in the
build pipeline ever put them there. A buyer's IT team opening the export finds
two fields that answer "which code made this?" with "no idea".

Nothing here guesses. Each value has an ordered list of real sources and falls
back to ``UNKNOWN`` only when every one of them is genuinely unavailable --
which is the state ``gate_provenance_complete`` refuses.
