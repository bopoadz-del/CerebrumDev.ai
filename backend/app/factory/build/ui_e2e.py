"""The UI a pilot serves must work, not resemble work.

``gate_ui_surface`` checked that declared .tsx files exist and are not tiny.
That is a facade check: FinOps (sess_065fc3eac75c4f62) passed it while
shipping a React app nothing builds -- no node step in its Dockerfile, just
``COPY . .`` -- so the real UI was dead source, and the served console drove
exactly one capability.

A pilot is handed to a DevOps team to deploy and test. What it serves has to
reach the platform end to end: more than one capability, the formulas it
ships, and an answer that carries its authority label. And it must serve ONE
UI -- a second, unbuilt one is decoration.
