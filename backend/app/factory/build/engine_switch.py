"""The database engine switch every platform ships: ``app/db.py``.

``DATABASE_URL`` was read in the generated kernel's config and used nowhere:
``grep -rln database_url`` over a live export returned that one file, while
``app/store.py`` was ``import sqlite3`` against a hardcoded
``<STORAGE_PATH>/platform.db``. An operator setting ``DATABASE_URL`` got a
platform that accepted the variable without complaint and quietly wrote a
SQLite file onto the container disk -- which is worse than not supporting
Postgres, because it looks supported.

The Factory cannot fix that by writing ``store.py``: the coder authors that
file, and overwriting it would destroy the capability work. So the Factory
owns the SWITCH and the floor obliges the author to route through it.
``app/db.py`` is substrate, present in every build; ``postgres_boot_200``
requires ``store.py`` to obtain its connection here and refuses a
``DATABASE_URL`` that is read and ignored.

Nothing here is domain-specific: it opens a database, whatever the platform
is for.

Written by the factory. DATABASE_URL set means Postgres; absent means a

app/store.py MUST obtain its connection from here and MUST NOT open its own
database. A DATABASE_URL that is read and then ignored is the failure this
module exists to prevent: the operator believes they are on Postgres while
the platform writes a SQLite file onto the container disk.
