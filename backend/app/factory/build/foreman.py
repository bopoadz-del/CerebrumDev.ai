"""The foreman: the architect's second entry point -- it DIAGNOSES and INSTRUCTS.

After a gate fails and the runner rule has classified the failure as REWORK
(``RoleRunner.decide``), and after every hard stop has been checked (same
failure twice, the gate's budget, the build ceiling), the foreman reads the
typed findings, the dispatched brief, what changed in the writer's tree since
the last green phase and the ledger tail, and writes a typed
:class:`ReworkInstruction`. The WRITER's work list is then the foreman's
instructions instead of the raw findings.

It never decides a gate, never edits tests, gates, the floor file or Factory
code, and never extends a budget: it runs only after the budgets have already
allowed the round, and a ``stop`` recommendation (honoured only at
``confidence >= STOP_CONFIDENCE``) can only END the build earlier.

Code validates every instruction before it reaches the writer:

* schema -- every field typed, ``confidence`` in [0, 1], ``recommend`` one of
  ``continue`` / ``stop``, a ``stop`` names its reason;
* the ratchet -- ``affected_capability_ids`` are blueprint capabilities and,
  when the typed findings localised the failure, a subset of the capabilities
  they named; every instruction's ``capability_id`` is one of the affected
  ids. An instruction can narrow the round, never widen it;
* the lane -- every instruction's ``file`` is a path the WRITER may write
  (authority.py), and never a Factory-rendered or stamped file (the harness,
  the self-check, the stamped product suites, CI workflows);
* the text -- the architect lint (shape only: session ids, another product's
  literals, unresolved block ids, template slots, ``[check:]`` tags, length),
  plus: a probe or stage id (``probe_set.json``, data) or a path in the
  TESTER's lane (``tests/**``) -- an instruction aimed at one probe or one test
  is a per-case branch.

A refused instruction is regenerated ONCE with the refusal; a second refusal
falls back to the raw typed findings (the behaviour before the foreman) and
is recorded. ``FACTORY_FOREMAN`` = ``off`` (default) | ``shadow`` | ``on``:
shadow calls, validates and records, and leaves the work list untouched.

A third entry point, :func:`audit_workspace` (F4), runs once per build after
TESTER passes and only PROPOSES checks for a human (``FACTORY_FOREMAN_AUDIT``);
:func:`suggested_checks` is the one reader the build status uses.
