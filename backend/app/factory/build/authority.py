"""Role authority kernel — build roles have lanes they cannot write outside of.

The factory's manufacturing run is not one free agent with a long prompt. It
is five roles with defined jobs, run in order, each handing a verified
workspace to the next:

    COLLECTOR -> CLONER -> WRITER -> TESTER -> STORE_MANAGER

"Defined jobs" is enforced here in code rather than asked for in a system
prompt, because a prompt instruction is advice and this needs to be a wall.
A two-hour run is a ratchet only if each phase can leave the workspace in
exactly one shape the next phase can verify; a WRITER that can quietly edit
``tests/`` to make them pass, or a TESTER that can patch ``app/`` instead of
reporting a failure, collapses the whole guarantee.

Two roots exist because the STORE_MANAGER is the one role that writes
*outside* the product being built — promoting reusable work back into the
Block Store is its job (see ``app.factory.store_manager`` for the op
vocabulary and approval gates that govern what it may publish).
