"""The product's DECLARED schema, read off its own ``app/models.py``.

One source for "a payload built from the capability's own schema". The
WRITER gate's probe builds its payload from the live ``MODELS`` (FIELDS +
CONSTRAINTS); TESTER's emitted suites (test_smoke, test_routes, domain
acceptance, negative floor, placeholder contract) built theirs from
``state["model_specs"]`` -- a spec captured once and refreshed from the
product only when it was empty. A writer that declared a field in a rework
round therefore changed nothing TESTER sampled, and the same test failed
again (live bf1e0e5c, sess_1fbea5094c2a4a57: WRITER gate green on the live
models, TESTER refused "a payload built from its own schema: tank_id is
required", rework, SAME_FAILURE_TWICE).

TESTER now reads the shipped models on every pass and merges them over the
state spec: the product's FIELDS decide WHICH fields exist (the declared
schema is the only source of fields), the state spec keeps the contracts it
mined onto them (vocabulary, bounds, envelope). Nothing here invents a field
or reads a name.
