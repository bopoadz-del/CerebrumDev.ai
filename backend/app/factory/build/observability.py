"""Operations substrate every platform ships: metrics, errors, limits, proof.

A pilot goes to a DevOps team. Structured logs alone leave them unable to
answer "is it up, is it slow, is it being hammered" without adding code to
someone else's product, and a backup nobody has restored is a file rather
than a backup.

None of this is domain-specific. It counts requests and seconds, dumps and
restores whatever the platform stores on, and runs the same 200 requests
against /health whatever the platform is for.

The Factory writes these when the agent has not. Mounting is one line in
app/main.py, which the agent owns, and the floor asks for it by name.
