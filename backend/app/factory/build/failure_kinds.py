"""Typed kinds for build failures, decided by what failed -- never by words.

A failure's kind travels beside its message: ``coder_failure_kinds[key]`` in
the run state and provenance, ``payload["failure_kind"]`` on a ledger event.
Readers (budget_inspect) count kinds; they never search the message text,
which is prose for a person and changes whenever someone rewords it.
