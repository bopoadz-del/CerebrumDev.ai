"""The role runner — drives a gated, lane-restricted, resumable build.

This is what turns the three kernels from inert checks into a manufacturing
run. It owns the phase order, hands each role a workspace it cannot write
outside of, runs the phase's gate afterwards, and drives the WRITER<->TESTER
rework loop until a gate passes or the budget is spent.

Three properties are load-bearing and each is enforced here rather than
trusted:

* **Gates are looked up by phase**, never supplied by the role. A role cannot
  weaken, mock or skip the check that judges it.
* **A spent budget is a failure.** A run that ends without its gates green
  terminates ``FAILED`` with the reason in the ledger. There is no code path
  that reports success for an ungated build -- that is the same "plausible
  green" hazard the gates were written against, and it must not be
  reintroduced one layer up.
* **Resume keys on the blueprint, not the output tree.** ``ProductGenerator``
  reports an ``inputs_hash`` that is really ``hash_tree`` of the generated
  output, so it changes whenever an LLM writes a handler. Keying resume on it
  would refuse every resume of an unchanged blueprint. :func:`blueprint_hash`
  hashes the inputs instead, which is stable by construction.

The role runner is the production default (``FACTORY_BUILD_ENGINE=runner``).
``ProductGenerator`` remains the template emitter and the source of the
14-class surfaces RoleRunner now converges onto. ``FACTORY_BUILD_ENGINE=template``
is the documented revert.
