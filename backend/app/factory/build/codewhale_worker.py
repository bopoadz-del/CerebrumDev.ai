"""The CodeWhale writer worker (Phase 5.1/5.4).

Runs the CodeWhale (DeepSeek) coding agent headless via ``codewhale exec``
from a job queue, under the tenant-scoped store handle (Phase 1 isolation
applies to the builder too), behind an explicit concurrency cap.

CONCURRENCY IS TWO-DIMENSIONAL. CerebrumDev.ai is multi-tenant: every
account gets its own shell and the coder deploys its own agents inside
it. A single process-wide counter cannot express that, so slots are
accounted on two independent axes:

    process cap  -- HOST PROTECTION. Total jobs in flight on this
                    instance, across every tenant. Sized from the box's
                    memory budget (see WORKER_PROFILES).
    tenant cap   -- FAIRNESS. Jobs in flight for ONE bound tenant. Stops
                    one account consuming every slot on the box.

Both refusals are NAMED and HARD: the job is refused, never silently run
and never silently queued, and the two exhaustion modes carry different
reason tokens so an operator reading a build log can tell "this user is
at their limit" from "the box is full".

VERIFIED (Phase 5.1): ``codewhale exec --auto --json`` completes a trivial
file job non-interactively -- agent mode, machine-readable summary,
termination_reason "resolved", no approval-prompt hang. The local probe
result is recorded in the PR report; T5.1 re-runs it wherever the CLI
exists and SKIPS with a reason elsewhere (CI has no codewhale binary).

The receipt records what the CLI actually reports: status,
termination_reason, provider, model, tool outcomes, output. Token-level
COGS is a named gap -- the CLI summary does not emit usage, so no cost
number is invented.

# THE CONDITION THAT FORCES THE SWAP: numInstances > 1, or Render

# real ceiling silently becomes numInstances x process_cap and the memory

# quietly stop meaning what they say.

# round-trip per slot acquire is a new failure mode for zero benefit at one
