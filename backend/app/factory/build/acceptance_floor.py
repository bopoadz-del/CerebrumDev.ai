"""The acceptance floor: one spec, two consumers.

The Store gate graded every build against thirteen checks that the coder was
never told. Neither the writer prompt nor the C-BRIEF named a single one of
them -- measured, not assumed: ``grep`` for ``no_token_401`` across both
returned zero. So the coder discovered the floor by failing it, one rework
round per check, and every one of those rounds is a full writer pass billed
to the customer.

Putting the rules in the brief alone would just move the trust back to the
author, which is the thing the gate exists to remove. So the floor lives in
``acceptance_floor.json`` and both sides read it:

* the writer prompt renders ``requirement`` verbatim, so the agent builds
  toward the floor on the first pass;
* the Store gate takes its checklist from the same ids.

Neither may hold its own copy. ``test_acceptance_floor_is_one_source`` fails
if the two consumers ever disagree, so drift is a red build rather than a
silent regression to the state this module was written to end.
