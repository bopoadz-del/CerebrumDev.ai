"""The kernel roster a platform publishes (``app/jobs.py``) -- one source.

``GET /v1/jobs`` / ``/v1/catalog`` / ``/v1/gates`` publish the Factory's own
role contracts. That data is the Factory's, never the coder's, and TESTER's
emitted ``test_kernel_jobs_roster`` asserts it. Both read it from here.

``run_writer`` stamped ``app/jobs.py`` only on its template path, below the
CodeWhale branch it returns at -- so in production the agent wrote its own
copy and the stamped test asserted keys that copy did not carry (live
2026-10-06, vineyard repro on dd1b353d: ``CATALOG = {}`` / ``GATES = {}`` ->
``KeyError: 'kernel'``, a FACTORY_FAULT the writer could never fix). The
CodeWhale path now stamps the roster too, from these same functions.

``CAPABILITIES`` is different: it is the product's capability manifest, and
it is one of the declared-entity sources the round-trip probes read
(``entity_contract``). The stamp KEEPS whatever manifest the product already
declares and never invents an entity (no capability-id fallback).
