"""The build level: the bar a build is measured against, chosen by the user.

The owner's ruling (2026-10-05): the bar comes from the brief. The Floor asks
for the level as a TYPED field -- the same pattern as the vertical and the
locale -- and the session and the blueprint both carry it. Nothing here reads
the brief's wording, and there is no default: a Floor build cannot start until
the user has chosen one (``floor_actions.require_build_level``).

The level is the single input that decides how far up the
CODE -> PRODUCT -> STORE ladder a run goes and how strict its top rung is:

=========== ============ ======================== ==================================
level       stops at     thin SUCCESS is failure  acceptance floor
=========== ============ ======================== ==================================
prototype   CODE         no                       not run (STORE is not reached)
light       STORE        no                       production-only checks advisory
pilot       STORE        yes                      production-only checks advisory
production  STORE        yes                      the full floor, every check enforced
=========== ============ ======================== ==================================

* **prototype** is DONE at CODE_GREEN: the code-phase suite passes and the run
  ends there. No pilot cycle opens; PRODUCT and STORE are NOT RUN, and the
  ledger says so.
* **light** climbs the whole ladder -- the pilot suite runs against the booted
  product and the Store gate measures acceptance -- but a pass whose handlers
  are mostly Factory templates still counts: a working demo, authorship not
  required. Light differs from pilot in strictness, not in reach, so the
  PRODUCT and STORE verdicts it reports are the same gates a pilot runs.
* **pilot** adds "thin SUCCESS is a failure": the authorship floor applies.
* **production** adds the acceptance floor in full: the production-only
  checks (the security scan) are enforced instead of advisory.

A blueprint that declares no level only reaches the runner from a direct,
non-Floor caller (the CLI, a test). Nothing is lowered for it: every gate the
run reaches is enforced in full, and how far it climbs stays the operator's
``FACTORY_AUTO_PILOT`` setting, exactly as before levels existed.
