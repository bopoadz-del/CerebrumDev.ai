"""The universal reasoning socket the Factory emits into every platform it builds.

One kernel, byte-identical in every product. The KIT is data the kernel loads, so
a hotel build and an airport build get the same socket and differ only in the
vocabulary vendored beside it. Nothing in the kernel knows what a runway or a
slab is -- that is the whole point, and it is why there is one file here rather
than one per vertical.

Emitted into a product:

    app/reasoning/kernel.py        the socket. Identical everywhere.
    app/reasoning/host.py          the four functions the PRODUCT fills in
    app/reasoning/pending.py       the unanswered interview questions
    app/reasoning/routes.py        where an answer arrives after the build
    app/reasoning/kit/manifest.yaml     vendored from the Store
    app/reasoning/kit/invariants.yaml   vendored from the Store
    app/reasoning/kit/questions.yaml    the domain owner's own question sheet,
                                        where the Store kit carries one
    app/reasoning/kit/design_basis.yaml the kit's OWN figure register, where it
                                        has one. Six Store kits do, and ONE of
                                        those is already answered -- so a platform
                                        built on it arrives holding real figures
                                        rather than an empty interview.

Five hook points, from the portable spec's routing map:

    H0 pre-retrieval   refuse without searching, and assert nothing was searched
    H1 ranking         lift the governing source class
    H2 tool-time       catch impossible values where they are born
    H3 answer-time     grounding, qualifier, provenance, currency, derivation
    H4 export-time     re-run H3 on the file before it leaves

FAIL CLOSED, twice over:

  * a kit that does not load disables itself and REFUSES every statement. It
    never degrades to "no invariants", because a kit with a typo becoming a kit
    with no gates is the failure this whole layer exists to prevent.
  * a host function the product has not implemented REFUSES. The emitted
    ``host.py`` raises ``HostNotWired`` rather than returning something empty,
    so a platform that forgot to wire retrieval cannot quietly answer ungated.

UNANSWERED FIGURES ARE NOT STUBS. A kit ships with every figure value null and
each null carrying the interview question that fills it. When the build interview
does not get an answer, the figure stays null and the platform REFUSES any
question that needs it, naming the interview question the operator must go and
answer. A stub would be a fake value that can ship silently and be mistaken for
real; a refusal cannot. An answer is stored with who gave it, when, and from
which document -- otherwise the interview has only moved the invented figure from
the model to the operator.
