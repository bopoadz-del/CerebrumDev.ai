"""Phase gates — the checks a role must pass before the next role starts.

A gate is the only reason a long build converges instead of drifting. Each
role hands over a workspace and a claim about it; the gate is what decides
whether the claim is true, independently of anything the role said about its
own work.

Gates are values, not methods on the roles, for exactly that reason -- a
role cannot supply, weaken or skip the check that judges it. The runner
looks the gate up by phase and runs it against the workspace.

Every gate returns a :class:`GateResult` rather than raising, because a
failure is normal control flow here: it is what sends the WRITER back round
for another pass. Only a gate that cannot run at all raises.
