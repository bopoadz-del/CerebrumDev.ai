"""Lane-restricted workspace handed to a build role.

A role never touches the filesystem directly. It gets one of these, and every
write is routed through :func:`app.factory.build.authority.assert_write_allowed`
for that role. A path outside the role's lane raises ``AuthorityError`` and
kills the build -- it is never caught, downgraded, or skipped, because the
whole value of the authority kernel is that a mis-scoped role aborts instead
of quietly producing an artifact whose provenance nobody can vouch for.

Reads are deliberately wider than writes: the WRITER must be able to read the
block contracts the CLONER vendored in order to write against them, but must
not be able to edit them. Reads are still confined to the workspace (or the
store root, when one is supplied) so a role cannot exfiltrate the factory.
