"""When a Factory Floor run should continue past code-cycle SUCCESS.

The residential-lettings export finished in ~14 minutes with
``rework_used=0`` and ``pilot_ready=false``. That was not a hang: the Floor
budget is a 20–30 minute *code* phase, the runner writes ``RUN_SUCCEEDED``
as soon as ``pytest -m "not pilot"`` is green, and the UI treated that
SUCCESS as "Finished / Download ready".

A Store-green platform is a *pilot* cycle on the same workspace (pytest
``-m pilot``, WRITER rework of failing capabilities, STORE ops). This
module is the single gate for opening that cycle automatically when a
factory coder key is configured, instead of parking on a thin prototype.
