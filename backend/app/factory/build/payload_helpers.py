"""The ONE request-payload builder every Factory-emitted suite uses.

Two emitted suites post to a capability route: ``tests/test_routes.py`` (the
route answers) and ``tests/test_placeholder_contract.py`` (a capability
calling a declared placeholder connector answers the typed 503 refusal). The
route checks the token (401), then the payload (422), then -- for a declared
placeholder -- refuses with 503. A contract test whose payload the route
refuses at 422 never reaches the refusal it is the authority on (live
2026-10-05: "Missing required field: member_id").

Both suites therefore build and correct their payloads with these helpers,
rendered from this module (product tests are not a package, so the source is
emitted into each file rather than imported):

* the Factory's spec sample is the base;
* every field the PRODUCT'S OWN model (``app.models.MODELS``) declares
  required and the base lacks is filled from that model -- its declared
  vocabulary, else its default when that is a real value, else the neutral
  sample of the default's type (``SAMPLE_VALUES``, the same table the
  Factory's spec sampler uses);
* a rejection the product states as data (``rejection_contract``) is
  corrected in the named field and retried, each (field, value) once.

Nothing here knows a capability, a field or a vocabulary by name.
