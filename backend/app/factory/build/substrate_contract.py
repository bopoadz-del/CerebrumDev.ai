"""Repair a factory-owned substrate module whose on-disk copy cannot satisfy
the NAME-level import contract of the factory's own stamped test.

D2 (live 2026-09-29, contractor platform — 10 projects, 6 users each): with
``stub_rate=1.0`` the WRITER left a stub ``app/domain_ops.py``. The substrate
backfills were "gaps only" — file exists → skip — so the stub survived, and
the factory's own stamped ``tests/test_domain_acceptance.py``
(``from app.domain_ops import OUTCOMES, perform_all``) died at COLLECTION.
The run then billed the agent a rework round for a module the factory, not the
agent, owns, and G5 halted on ``SAME_FAILURE_TWICE``.

"File exists" is not "contract satisfied". A factory-owned substrate module a
stamped test imports specific NAMES from must actually provide those names.
This module decides, per file:

  * write    — the file is absent; the backfill writes the canonical copy.
  * keep     — the file exists and provides every required name (agent wrote a
               real one, or a prior backfill already ran). Left untouched.
  * repair   — the file exists, is imported for specific names, and provides
               NONE of them: a stub the factory owns. Replaced with canonical.
  * conflict — the file provides SOME required names but not all: possibly real
               authored work the factory must not overwrite. Left untouched and
               reported; the caller halts the run as FACTORY (no rework).

A module imported only whole (``from app import backup``) has no name contract,
so it is never repaired — an agent-authored copy of such a module is preserved
exactly as before.
