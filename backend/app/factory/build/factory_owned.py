"""The files the Factory owns in a product, and whether the writer touched one.

Owner rule (2026-10-08): the writer never authors a Factory-owned file. A
writer that creates, edits or deletes one is sent back to rework with the path
named -- never silently overwritten afterwards, never silently kept.

Live 2026-10-08 (cycle 2 fintech, sess_59090c3bd0964425,
build/plt_464389e32e544810 @ 22e6be03): the writer invented
docs/provenance/provenance.json from the blueprint and blocks.lock.json; the
Factory's gap-filling converge then kept it, so the Factory's own provenance
(factory_commit, blocks_commit) never landed and provenance_complete failed.

One declared list, built from the sources that already own these paths --
nothing here names a product, a blueprint or a branch:

* every path a Factory stamp owns outright (``stamp_registry.owned_paths``):
  the acceptance harness, the writer self-check, the deploy modules, the
  release gate, CI, the TESTER bootstrap and suites, the pins;
* the product's provenance record, which only the Factory writes (converge);
* the Store gate workflow the checkpoint carries from cerebrum-builds main.
