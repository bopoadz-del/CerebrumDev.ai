"""Build ledger — the durable, resumable record of one manufacturing run.

A two-hour build cannot be a function call whose only output is its return
value. It has to survive an interrupt, be auditable afterwards, and answer
"what did each role actually do" without anyone having to trust a summary.

The ledger is append-only JSONL for that reason: a crash mid-phase leaves
every prior line intact and readable, where a rewritten JSON document would
leave a truncated file and no history. Nothing here mutates or deletes a
past event -- a phase that is re-run appends a new event, and
:meth:`BuildLedger.completed_roles` reads the latest verdict per role.

The ledger is also the registrar's source of truth. ``CLONE`` events record
which block landed in which platform at which commit, so the Store Manager
can answer "what did this platform take from the store, and has any of it
gone stale against store head" by reading ledgers rather than by re-scanning
delivered artifacts.

Only the orchestrator writes here, and only through :meth:`BuildLedger.append`
(which always assigns ``seq``). Roles do not -- a role that can edit the
record of its own gate is the same hole that
:mod:`app.factory.build.authority` closes for source files. FACTORY_CODE_CLI
runs inside the workspace and has been seen appending seq-less NOTE objects
as raw JSONL (CEREBRUMDEV-BACKEND-B). Readers quarantine that shape;
:meth:`BuildLedger.protect` makes the file owner-readonly during a role.
