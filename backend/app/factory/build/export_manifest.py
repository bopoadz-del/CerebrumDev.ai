"""The honest zip manifest (Phase 6).

Every exported platform carries ``MANIFEST.json`` declaring what it really
is — engine version, retrieval mode, embedder + vector store, populated
layers with object counts, tenant id, tenancy mode, prompt version, the CI
run id that greened it, and whether the kit engine is included. The UI's
export label is DERIVED from the manifest: it is impossible to render
"RAG included" unless the manifest says ``vector_rag`` AND the engine
files are present, and impossible to render multi-tenant unless the mode
says so.

Tenancy mode strings reflect the real stack (option B): the factory runs
no Postgres RLS, so the honest values are ``single_tenant_only`` and
``multi_tenant_partition`` — ``multi_tenant_rls`` from prompt v1.1 is
deliberately NOT a value here because no such mode exists in this
codebase. This deviation is named, not hidden.

The zip itself is refused (``zip_requires_green_ci``) unless the CI run
that greened the build is recorded AND the Phase 0.5 artifact gate holds
(agent-authored artifacts > 0). A manifest claim that the zip's contents
do not back is ``manifest_mismatch`` — verified, not trusted.
