"""U6: the authorized write path from the Factory to Cerebrum-Blocks.

STORE_MANAGER's mandate has always said harvesting improvements back
upstream "remains unbuilt", and ``harvest.py`` has been an honest BLOCK
around that hole: ``store_write_exists`` was the literal ``False``. Every
correction the Factory learned — Store-unwired adapters, permissions that
contradict behaviour, ``ui_schema`` fields the published contract omits —
stayed in this repo's emission, so each new product re-shipped the same
upstream defects.

This module is that missing half. Its shape is chosen so that a wrong
harvest is recoverable:

* **Never ``main``.** A harvest writes to a fresh branch in a Cerebrum-Blocks
  checkout. A human reviews and merges. There is no code path here that
  commits to the default branch.
* **Never pushes by default.** ``execute_harvest`` plans and, when asked,
  writes and commits locally. Pushing is a separate, explicit act — the
  network is the one step that cannot be undone by deleting a branch.
* **Fail closed on a dirty checkout.** Committing on top of someone's
  uncommitted work would mix their changes into a Factory harvest commit.
* **Authorization is a committed file, not an env var.** A dashboard secret
  must not be able to write to the Store. ``build/stages/HARVEST_AUTHORIZED.json``
  has to name this exact repo, and lands through review like anything else.

The payload is computed, never hand-listed: :func:`plan_harvest` derives it
from the same survey that reports the divergence, so the thing harvested is
by construction the thing detected.
