"""Re-write the Factory's own files on a re-entered build.

A build resumed from an earlier run -- or attached from its cerebrum-builds
branch -- carries the Factory files of the Factory that FIRST built it. When
the Factory has since been fixed, those old copies keep failing the build:
live, a hotel platform built before the release-gate fix kept a
``scripts/release_gate.py`` that demands a withheld file, so every resume
failed its Docker image at 0/13 no matter how green the product was.

So on re-entry, before TESTER, the files the Factory owns outright are
re-rendered from the CURRENT templates. Only files that are pure Factory
templates with no coder content; the coder's files (handlers, models, routes,
dispatch) are never touched.

requirements.txt is MERGED, never replaced: every line the build declares
(a Postgres driver, say) stays, and only the vendored blocks' missing
obligations are added.

Before #683 the Factory appended its lines UNMARKED, under
``LEGACY_BLOCK_HEADER``, once per refresh. Those lines are the Factory's, not
the product's, but the marker reader cannot tell -- so a branch of record kept
every package an older Factory ever stamped, for blocks it no longer vendors
(live 2026-10-07: ``marker-pdf`` pinned ``pillow<11`` into a vineyard image
that imports neither, and 33 pillow advisories were billed to the writer).
The merge removes those legacy blocks and re-derives the Factory's lines into
its marked block, so a stale Factory line goes with the stamp that owns it.
