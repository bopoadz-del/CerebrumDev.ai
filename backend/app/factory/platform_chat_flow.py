"""Chat-driven platform creation flow.

Bridges free-text chat messages onto the EXISTING session product state
machine (routers/session_product.py). No parallel machinery: the same
draft_blueprint_from_brief / plan_blueprint / generate_product functions,
the same ProductDesignState on the session. The chat is simply a second
front door onto the same house.

Routing contract (this is law, the smoke tests enforce it):
    1. Explicit commands ALWAYS enter the platform flow:
     "/platform <brief>", "new platform <brief>", "platform: <brief>".
    2. Free-text NLP intent ("build me a platform for hotels") enters the
     platform flow by DEFAULT — factory doctrine: the chat's purpose is
     building platforms. Set PLATFORM_CHAT_FLOW_ENABLED=off to keep the
     legacy kit-configurator routing for unauthenticated deployments.
    3. When a factory LLM key is configured, the chat LLM decides the action
     (draft / start_coder / reply). start_coder is the only chat door that
     launches the WRITER coding agent. Regex approval ("approve") is the
     offline fallback when the LLM is unset or the call fails.
    4. Approval starts WRITER when a blueprint is pending. continue/resume
     resumes an in-flight or interrupted (non-terminal) run even after the
     blueprint is already approved — a pending unapproved blueprint is not
     required. After code-phase 5/5 SUCCESS, continue opens a pilot cycle
     on the same workspace (pytest -m pilot + STORE ops), not a new product.
     A RUN_FAILED / rework-exhausted ledger is terminal: same-hash continue
     or a new brief must start a fresh workspace (reset rework budget),
     never a no-op resume of the dead run. ``HANDOFF_TO_N3`` is
     also not a coding-failure terminal: continue / start_coder ingests
     the cerebrum-builds ``store-gate`` 12/12 status and must not
     re-enter WRITER or launch another Background Agent.
    5. Kit-configurator vocabulary (chain/blocks/kits/domain/lora/...) stays
     in the legacy chat flow even when it also mentions a platform noun.
    6. Anything else falls through to the normal kit-configurator chat.
