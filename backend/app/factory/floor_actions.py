"""Typed Floor actions: what the user asked the Factory to DO.

The Floor's controls (Approve, Continue, Run pilot, Draft, the feature-list
editor, rename, vertical, the build level, Confirm on a proposed intake) send
an explicit ``action`` -- and a ``value`` where the action takes one -- with
the chat request. The Factory dispatches on that field. It never reads the
user's words to decide an action: free-typed text goes to the Floor chat LLM,
whose answer is itself a typed decision, and with no LLM configured free text
gets an honest pointer to the controls. (The regexes this replaces matched
"approve", "go ahead", "rename to ...", "make it a prototype" ... in the
message and decided by them.)
