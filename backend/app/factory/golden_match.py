"""Route a drafted brief to a golden blueprint by STRUCTURE, never by words.

A golden is a blueprint on disk that declares the verticals it serves
(``serves_verticals``) -- opting in is data, not a Factory list. Its declared
structure is its capability ids, its serves_verticals, and the capabilities
declared by the Store kit that serves its vertical, when there is one.

A draft's structure is its capability ids, its vertical and the caller's
vertical hint. The two are compared by Jaccard similarity over ids. The best
golden wins only if it clears the configured threshold and is the unique best;
a tie means no golden and the product is built from the draft. Nothing here
reads the brief's text.
