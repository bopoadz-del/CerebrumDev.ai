"""Wall-clock watchdog around factory LLM HTTP posts.

httpx's ``timeout=N`` is idle-based: a streaming or keepalive response
resets the read timer on every byte, so a reasoning model that dribbles
tokens (or an upstream that never closes) can occupy the WRITER for tens
of minutes. Live sess_3f3115ba6d764102 sat in WRITER with
"quiet for 14+ min — model call may still be running" because of this.

#291 joined a daemon thread for ``timeout_s``. That releases the caller
ONLY if ``Thread.join(timeout)`` returns. Live sess_97a1bc6525924e8b
waited 1965s against a 480s attempt wall (production
``FACTORY_CODER_TIMEOUT_S=150`` × 3 legs + 30s grace): join was waited
without cancelling the socket, so a hung httpx/ssl/anyio thread pinned
the WRITER until the upstream finally dropped.

#297 switched the wait to ``Event.wait`` and called ``httpx.Client.close()``
on the caller thread. Live sess_ab446de still waited 1085s vs 480s
(~2.3×). Proven path: ``Event.wait`` *does* return near the per-leg
cap, but ``Client.close()`` → httpcore pool close → ``SSLSocket.close``
takes the SSL lock the worker holds in ``SSL_read``. The raise therefore
runs only after the proxy finally drops the TLS session (often ~18 min).
That is a post-wait cleanup hang, not a join miss and not a reset
contextvar.

This helper:

* waits on ``Event.wait(timeout)`` — never ``join`` after the deadline
* never runs ``Client.close()`` on the caller thread
* shuts the raw socket down (unbound ``socket.shutdown``) on a daemon
  thread so ``SSL_read`` unblocks without taking the SSL lock
* honours an optional monotonic ``deadline`` so stacked legs cannot
  outrun ``attempt_wall_s()``

The 510s live abort (sess MakersHub Leeds, SHA da47307) was this wall
firing at production ``FACTORY_CODER_TIMEOUT_S=150`` × 3 + 30s grace.
That band is a hang detector leftover, not a coding budget. Production
defaults are 20 min per HTTP post and 40 min per calling-NOTE; a truly
hung/dribbling socket still dies at those walls. The Store-green build
wall (2 hours) is the coding budget.
