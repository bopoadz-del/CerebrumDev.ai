"""What the Store's kits declare about themselves, read at build time.

The Factory holds no kit facts. Which kit serves a vertical, whether the
operator declared it ready to build against, and which of its blocks are
domain content are fields of the kit's own manifest in the Store:

* domain kits   ``block_store/kits/<kit>/manifest.json``  -- ``serves_verticals``,
  ``build_ready``, ``blocks``;
* reasoning kits ``app/blocks/<kit>/manifest.yaml`` (+ ``invariants.yaml``)
  -- ``serves_verticals``.

A vertical is served by the kit whose id IS the vertical or whose
``serves_verticals`` lists it. Nothing here names a kit or a vertical.
