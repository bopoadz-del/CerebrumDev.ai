"""The intake the USER declared on the Floor: country, currency, build level.

Typed fields, each validated by SHAPE only -- 2 / 3 uppercase letters for the
country and currency (no list of countries or currencies exists anywhere in
the Factory), one of the defined build levels for the level. They persist on
the session's product design and are copied onto the stored blueprint
(``blueprint.locale``, ``blueprint.build_level``), which every build path
reads, so the money contract and the build's bar judge the build against what
the user said and nothing else. Never inferred from the brief's prose.

The Floor chat ASKS for them and may PROPOSE values from the user's answer
(``intake_proposal``). A proposal stores nothing: only the typed
``confirm_intake`` action -- the user pressing Confirm -- turns it into the
typed fields, exactly as if the user had typed each one.
