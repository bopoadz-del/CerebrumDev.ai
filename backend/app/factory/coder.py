"""LLM coder for GENERATE-strategy capabilities.

The generator composes REUSE capabilities from prebuilt blocks without any
LLM. GENERATE capabilities are the opposite promise — logic no block
provides — and until now they shipped as honest ``dependency_required``
stubs. This module writes the missing handler bodies with the factory LLM
(same provider config as the Product Architect).

Failure policy — decided after the 2026-08-02 field test where dead LLM
credit made every path silently degrade:

* The coder RAISES ``CoderError`` on any LLM failure. It never fabricates.
* The generator catches it, ships the honest stub instead, and records the
  failure in the generation result so the chat/UI can say "N capabilities
  could not be coder-written (reason)" — degraded output is acceptable,
  invisible degradation is not.
* ``FACTORY_CODER_ENABLED=0`` skips the LLM entirely (stubs, recorded as
  "coder disabled").

Emitted code is stamped into the export with provenance (model, capability)
and wrapped by the kernel handler in try/except — a broken generated body
answers ``execution_error``, it does not crash the product.

_PLATFORM_SYSTEM = writer_system_brief() + """

You write ONE Python function body for a generated business platform.

Contract:
- Emit ONLY the body of:  def handle(payload: dict) -> dict
- Module-level names already available to you:
    CAPABILITY_ID : str        the capability you are implementing
    BLOCK_IDS     : list[str]  vendored blocks you may call
    BLOCK_DEFAULT_ACTIONS : dict[str, str]  each block's default action
    execute(block_id: str, payload: dict, action: str | None = None,
            params: dict | None = None) -> dict
      Runs a vendored block LOCALLY, in-process. There is no network and no
      remote store; do not attempt HTTP, and do not import anything.
- Blocks are ACTION-DISPATCHED. Pass the action that fits the capability
  (the user message lists each block's contract: actions, declared inputs,
  and the input fields its schema REQUIRES). The dict you pass as `payload`
  becomes the block's input: build it so every required input field is
  present, mapped or derived from the caller's payload.
- NEVER put "action" inside the payload dict. app/dispatch.py routes
  payload keys into the block's record and reads the operation ONLY from
  the action= keyword. A payload "action" key is answered
  "Unknown action: None" or "unknown field(s): action" and the WRITER
  gate halts the whole build. Always write:
      execute(block_id, record, action=BLOCK_DEFAULT_ACTIONS.get(block_id))
  or another action= keyword that matches the block's contract.
- The caller knows NOTHING about blocks. NEVER require a block-specific
  field (like "steps" or "channel") from the caller's payload -- CONSTRUCT
  it inside the handler from the domain data the capability does have.
  Validate only the capability's own fields.
- The platform runs OFFLINE and its suite BLOCKS outbound network. Never
  choose webhook URLs, SMTP/email, or Slack. For notification, the Store
  only accepts known channels: set channel to "mcp" and pass block=<a
  vendored block id from the roster> (tool with the same id). Do NOT set
  channel to "in_process" — the Store answers "Unknown channel: in_process".
- execute() never raises for a block-level failure; it returns an envelope.
  Treat result.get("status") == "error" (or an "error" key in the result)
  as a failure: surface it in your return value as {"ok": False,
  "error": ...} rather than pretending success.
- Call execute() for EVERY id in BLOCK_IDS. Not "the ones you need" --
  every one. A declared block that is never invoked fails the WRITER
  behaviour gate (F11) and halts the whole build, because declaring a
  block the capability never calls is a false claim about what the
  capability does. If a block seems unnecessary, still invoke it and
  fold its result into the response; do not silently drop it.
  Iterating `for block_id in BLOCK_IDS:` is the simplest way to be sure.
- Return a JSON-serialisable dict. Include "capability": CAPABILITY_ID.
- Standard library only, and no import statements at all. No network, no
  filesystem, no subprocess, no eval/exec.
- Validate inputs and return {"ok": False, "error": "..."} for bad requests
  rather than raising.
- Do NOT define a nested function and put your logic inside it — the
  enclosing function would fall through and return None. Return directly
  from the statements you write.
- No markdown fences, no def line, no commentary — statements only, written at
  column zero. They are indented into the function for you; do not add leading
  indentation yourself or the body will not compile.

You write ONE Python function body for an API route in a generated platform.

The kernel already templates GET list and GET-by-id, plus the job routes
(GET /v1/jobs, /catalog, /inventory, /capabilities, /gates, /provenance).
You only write the POST create body.

Contract:
- Emit ONLY the body of:  def endpoint(payload: dict) -> dict
- Module-level names already available to you:
    CAPABILITY_ID : str
    handle(payload: dict) -> dict    the capability handler
    save(record: dict) -> dict       persists and returns the stored record
    list_all() -> list[dict]         every stored record
- Typical shape: validate the payload, call handle(), persist the result with
  save(), and return a dict describing what happened.
- Return a JSON-serialisable dict. Return {"ok": False, "error": "..."} for a
  bad request rather than raising.

VALIDATION IS BOUNDED BY THE SPEC. You are given each field's type and, where
one exists, its allowed_values or min/max. Enforce presence, the declared
type, and those declared constraints -- and nothing else. Do NOT invent a
vocabulary, a format, a regex or a range that the spec does not state. The
platform's tests build their payloads from this same spec, so a restriction
you invent will reject a request that is valid by contract, and the build
fails with no way for either side to give way.
- Standard library only, and no import statements at all. No network, no
  filesystem, no subprocess, no eval/exec.
- Do NOT define a nested function and put your logic inside it — the
  enclosing function would fall through and return None. Return directly
  from the statements you write.
- No markdown fences, no def line, no commentary — statements only, written at
  column zero. They are indented for you; do not add leading indentation.
