"""Auth for CerebrumDev.ai backend — master key + per-user credentials.

Resolution order for every request:
1. ``CEREBRUM_DEV_API_KEY`` (master/admin key) — full access, header only.
2. Per-account API key (``cdk_…``) via Bearer or X-API-Key.
3. Per-account login token (``cdt_…``) via Bearer, then the HttpOnly ``cdt`` cookie.
4. No master key configured AND ``ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_DEV=1`` → open dev principal.

The anonymous dev principal is opt-in. It used to be the fallback whenever no
master key was configured, gated only by ``ENV == "production"`` matching that
exact string. That failed open: an unset or misspelled ``ENV``, or a typo in
the ``CEREBRUM_DEV_API_KEY`` variable name, silently granted every caller a
``dev`` principal. Because ownership checks throughout the codebase are written
as ``if principal.kind == "user"``, a ``dev`` principal bypasses every one of
them and reads all tenants' sessions, products and uploads, with billing and
trial quotas disabled. One missing environment variable must not do that, so
open mode now requires deliberate opt-in and the process refuses to boot
without either a master key or that opt-in.

Set ``ACCOUNTS_REQUIRE_VERIFIED_EMAIL=1`` to block unverified accounts from
all credential-gated routes (403 ``email_not_verified``). Verification and
password-reset endpoints stay public so users can always complete the flow.
