"""Platform grounding stage — mandatory verdict on every produced answer.

Verdicts:
- ``grounded``          every checkable claim traces to a supplied source
- ``flag-as-estimate``  unsupported figures exist; answer is released only
                        with an explicit estimate disclosure attached
- ``blocked``           the answer invents URLs (or, in strict mode, figures);
                        the allowed response is ``None`` — never a raw
                        ungrounded fallback

Every verdict is persisted to an append-only JSONL audit log under
``STORAGE_PATH/grounding/verdicts.jsonl``.

    ``strict`` existed from the start and no caller ever passed it, so the

    This makes the branch reachable and on by default.

    The cost is real and worth stating: a *derived* figure — one the model

    spell out — is indistinguishable from a fabricated one to a detector that
