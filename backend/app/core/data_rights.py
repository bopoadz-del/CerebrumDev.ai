"""Data rights: erasure and export across every store that holds user data.

The accounts database is only one of the places a user's data lives. Session
state, uploaded files, extracted text, vector embeddings and Google Drive OAuth
tokens all sit on disk or in Chroma, keyed by ``session_id`` — and the only
index from an account to its sessions is ``accounts_store.session_owners``.
This module is the single place that walks that index and takes everything
down in a safe order.

Design rules, each of which exists because the obvious implementation is wrong:

* **Vectors before files.** ``session_store.get_session`` falls back to
  ``_rehydrate_from_chroma`` when the disk snapshot is missing. Deleting the
  session directory while leaving the Chroma collection standing does not erase
  the session — it *resurrects* it on the next read, re-attributed to
  ``user_id="anonymous"``. A failed vector purge is a resurrection path, not a
  cosmetic leftover.
* **No ``ignore_errors=True``.** A silent ``rmtree`` that swallows a Windows
  file-handle error and returns cleanly is exactly the partial purge that
  claims success. Every failure is caught per session and named in the report.
* **"Cannot check" is not "clean".** ``chroma_store.collection_exists``
  returns False on any exception, so a host without ``chromadb`` installed
  would otherwise report a spotless vector purge. Absent, purged and
  unavailable are three different statuses here.
* **Never widen beyond the ownership index.** Nothing globs the sessions
  directory. A session whose ownership row was never written is unreachable,
  and is reported as such rather than guessed at.
