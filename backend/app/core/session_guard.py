"""Session ownership guard — one dependency for every session-scoped route.

Every router mounted under ``/v1/sessions/{session_id}/…`` must resolve the
session through :func:`require_owned_session` so that account credentials
(``cdt_`` login tokens / ``cdk_`` API keys) can only touch their own sessions.
Admin (master key) and local-dev principals pass through, mirroring the
ownership rule in ``routers/sessions.py``: cross-account access gets a
non-leaking 404.
