"""Honesty invariant: /health flag fields are EVALUATED bools, one source of truth.

Root cause (2026-07-28): /health reported `resident_engineer_enabled` as the raw
env string via `os.getenv(..., "false")`, while `build_mode_enabled` and
`kimi_workbench_enabled` reported `_truthy()`-evaluated bools. Two sources of
truth — health was the unreliable one, and it let the same env value read as
"enabled" in one place and "disabled" in another.

This pins the contract that would have caught it: for ANY raw env string, each
health flag field is a real bool and equals the flag function's evaluation. A
raw-string leak (the original bug) fails the `is bool` assertion immediately.
