"""The Cerebrum Reasoning Kernel gold (docs/REASONING_KERNEL.md) is ratified and
immutable — same doctrine as the Universal Kernel gold and the Product Delivery
Standard: ratify a new version, never edit in place.

Factory-only artifact: the brain to the Universal Kernel's body. It is NOT
shipped to Cerebrum-Blocks or to products — when the Reasoning Kernel mission
fires, briefs are rendered from this gold, and only its outputs cross repos.
