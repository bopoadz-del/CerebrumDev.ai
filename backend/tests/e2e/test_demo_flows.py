"""End-to-end demo flows for CerebrumDev.ai — the stranger, encoded.

  D2  health 200
  D3  drive the "generate a platform" flow: brief -> blueprint -> export
      artifact exists and is shaped like a runnable platform (action routes +
      console UI), and the export ships its own smoke tests.
  D4  an unauthenticated request to a protected route is rejected (401).

D3 runs fully offline: when no architect LLM credit is available the factory
falls back to deterministic drafting, and generation is deterministic block
composition (no LLM) by design.
