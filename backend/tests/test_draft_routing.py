"""Draft routing regression tests.

Contract:
- LLM drafting must run BEFORE the golden-steward shortcut when enabled.
- The word "estate" alone must NOT preempt the LLM (vineyard estate, real
  estate, estate planning briefs should reach the architect).
- Golden steward remains the deterministic fallback for explicit steward
  intent when LLM drafting is disabled.
