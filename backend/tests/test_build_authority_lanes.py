"""Build roles must be confined to their lane by code, not by prompt.

New-shape tests for the manufacturing kernel. The failure these guard against
is not a crash — it is a *quietly valid-looking* build: a WRITER that edits
the tests judging it, a TESTER that patches the code under test, or any role
that walks out of the workspace via ``..`` or a symlink and edits the factory
itself. Each of those produces an artifact that passes its gate and means
nothing, so every one of them has to raise.
