"""The API base baked into the SPA must be a host that actually serves the API.

The public listener on :443 routes by HOST, not path:

    api.cerebrum-dev.com                        -> cerebrumdev-backend
    cerebrum-dev.com, www.cerebrum-dev.com      -> cerebrumdev-frontend
    theshovel.ai, www.theshovel.ai              -> the-fork

The :80 listener routes by PATH instead, sending /v1/*, /health, /ready,
/version, /docs and /openapi.json to the backend. Those two facts are why this
file exists: a same-origin base (``VITE_API_URL`` empty, which makes
frontend/src/api/factory.ts fall back to ``''``) is correct on :80 and dead on
:443. Over HTTPS, ``https://www.cerebrum-dev.com/v1/auth/me`` matches the
frontend host rule and returns this SPA's own index.html with status 200 and
content-type text/html. Every API call becomes a page of HTML parsed as JSON,
and :443 is what the public gets.

The other end of the range is just as broken: baking the load balancer's own
generated ``*.elb.amazonaws.com`` name as http:// means a page served over
HTTPS makes http requests, which browsers block as mixed content.

So the baked value must be the dedicated API host over https. Vite resolves it
at BUILD time (frontend/Dockerfile.prod takes it as a build arg), so a wrong
value is not a restart away from correct -- it ships inside the bundle and the
cutover looks done while the app is dead. These tests fail before that ships.
