"""A staged commit never copies a file onto itself.

Live 2026-10-08 (98d3a356, rotation cycle 1, a rotation pick at WRITER): the
build thread crashed with "PosixPath('….staging-writer/blocks.lock.json') and
PosixPath('…/blocks.lock.json') are the same file". The coding agent works in
the staging tree and can leave there a link to the product's own file (a
symlink or a hard link into the destination); ``record_existing`` records every
file under staging, and ``commit()`` then asked shutil to copy the destination
file onto itself -- shutil.SameFileError, the build thread died, the product
was lost for a bookkeeping copy that had nothing to do.

The rule: a staged path that already IS the destination file is committed by
doing nothing, and the destination keeps its bytes.
