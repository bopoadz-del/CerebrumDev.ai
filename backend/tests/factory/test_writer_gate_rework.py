"""A failed WRITER gate sends the writer back round; it does not end the build.

Live (210d6812, a vineyard brief at production level): every capability
answered ok=true over a failed block (F1). The writer's own suite was green --
it cannot see F1, which needs every block call made to fail -- and the WRITER
gate's failure was terminal, so one variant writer pass killed the export. The
same brief had passed that gate on the previous build.

Two mechanisms, both tested here:

1. A WRITER-gate failure on a check the compiled brief defines is a budgeted
   rework round (the TESTER's rework loop, the same budget and the same
   same-failure-twice rule), with the gate's typed findings in the writer's
   work list. A check the brief never defined goes advisory, as for TESTER.
2. The Factory stamps the gate's own probe into the workspace
   (scripts/factory_checks.py) so the writer can run what the gate runs
   before it declares done; the brief tells it to.

The capability ids below are made up for this file.
