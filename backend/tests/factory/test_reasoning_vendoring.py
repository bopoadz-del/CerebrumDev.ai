"""Vendoring the kit into the product — the step that makes a built platform gate.

The socket used to emit five code files and leave ``app/reasoning/kit/`` empty. The
kernel then disabled itself and refused every statement, which is correct by the
fail-closed rule and useless: the platform gated nothing and could answer nothing
either. These tests drive the vendoring, and the last one takes a REAL Store kit
through it and runs the emitted kernel against it, because "the files were copied"
is not the same claim as "the built platform gates".
