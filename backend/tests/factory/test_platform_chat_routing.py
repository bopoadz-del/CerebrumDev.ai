"""Factory-floor routing triage — retail build must never leak to the legacy
kit-chain generator, and card summaries must be emitted exactly once.

Covers the two live bugs from user testing:
(a) "Generated chain failed validation" on a standard retail request — the
    message fell through to the legacy chain path (either the intent regex
    missed the phrasing, or a pending blueprint + unrecognized message leaked
    through). The kernel refusal was correct; the routing was not.
(b) Doubled blueprint text — the summary was emitted both in the card event
    and again as a word-by-word delta stream appended to the same bubble.
