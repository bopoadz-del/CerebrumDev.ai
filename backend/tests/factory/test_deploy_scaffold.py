"""A delivered platform must be deployable, not merely runnable locally.

New-shape tests for the deploy scaffold. The runner produced a working
application with no way to ship it: an inventory against the template
generator showed Dockerfile, Procfile, render.yaml and .env.example among the
83 files only the old path emitted. Without them the artifact runs on a
developer's machine and nowhere else.

The scaffold is templated rather than coder-written on purpose. Container and
process config is mechanical — there is no domain judgement for an agent to
add, and a hallucinated base image or start command is a deployment failure
rather than a test failure.
