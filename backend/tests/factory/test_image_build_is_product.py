"""A product image that does not build is the PRODUCT's Store-gate failure.

Live 2026-10-06 (build/plt_50b41be2cb184931): the writer's Dockerfile ran the
test suite inside ``docker build``; the Factory-rendered release gate refused
without pytest and the image never built. The gate run had no score, so the
Factory read it as "the Factory's own workflow failed before scoring" -- a
Factory defect -- and the writer was never told. The gate now scores a failed
image build (the floor's ``stage: image`` checks FAIL, the rest NOT_RUN, the
log tail as evidence), and the Factory routes that to a writer rework.
