"""The Floor chat holds a conversation before it drafts.

The chat LLM used to be a four-way switch: it was sent the current message
alone -- no history -- and could only draft / start / refine / reply. A
first brief became a blueprint instantly, with nothing asked. From the
owner's side: "no conversation at all ... it is like hard wired".

Now it can ``ask_user`` first. It sees the conversation and the Store
inventory, the user's answers are folded verbatim into the brief the
architect drafts from, and the number of question rounds is capped in code
rather than left to the model.
