"""Two-axis worker concurrency: the platform serves many tenants at once.

CerebrumDev.ai is a multi-tenant Factory: every account gets its own shell
and the coder deploys its own agents inside it. Concurrency accounting
therefore has TWO dimensions, and the tests below are the gate on both:

    process cap -- host protection. Total in flight on this instance.
    tenant cap  -- fairness. In flight for ONE bound tenant.

Before the fix these were the same number (a single module-level
``_active_jobs`` int), so ONE tenant holding the only slot refused every
other tenant on the platform. The tests named "does_not_refuse" and
"cannot_take_every" fail on that code.

STUB-DRIVEN: no ``codewhale`` subprocess, no network. Tenants are REAL
``bind_tenant_store`` bindings — the same server-derived sha256 digests
production uses — never a hand-rolled fake, so the key under test is the
key the worker actually receives.
