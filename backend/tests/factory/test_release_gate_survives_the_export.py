"""The release gate must pass on the tree the customer actually receives.

Live, sess_51acb4ce7102491f -- STORE_MANAGER reported:

    The coding agent stopped: acceptance.py in Docker 0/13.

Acceptance never ran. The product's Dockerfile ends with
``RUN python3 scripts/release_gate.py``; that script printed

    108 passed, 9 skipped
    docs/build_provenance.json: MISSING
    VERDICT: FAIL

so the IMAGE failed to build, the acceptance step was skipped, and the
parser reported a skipped run as 0/13. Two Factory decisions disagreed:
``builds_push.FACTORY_INTERNAL_PATHS`` withholds docs/build_provenance.json
from everything that ships (owner: "they stay in house"), while the release
gate the Factory writes into every product REQUIRED it.

It had happened before. The earlier fix guarded that the file exists in the
WORKSPACE -- it always does. Nothing checked the tree that SHIPS. So these
tests put a workspace through the real export filter and run the real
rendered gate on what comes out: whatever is withheld, the gate must survive.
