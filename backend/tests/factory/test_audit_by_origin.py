"""audit_clean ownership by line origin (owner decision 4).

A bandit / pip-audit finding in a file or dependency the WRITER authored goes
to the writer with file:line; one in Factory substrate (stamped files, vendored
Store code, the Factory's base requirements) is the Factory's and advisory for
the build -- the build is not failed for it. Provenance comes from the build's
factory receipt (factory_receipt.py), never from a filename; a finding whose
origin cannot be established is a Factory fault, never silently the writer's.
