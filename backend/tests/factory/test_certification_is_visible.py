"""The Factory can tell a vouched-for block from an unproven one.

Every block.json in the Store carries ``trust_tier: "platform"`` -- all 164 of
them. So the only trust signal the Factory had was a constant, and it attached
a block nobody had certified exactly as readily as one that had survived the
Store's control-delete. The evidence was sitting in block_certifications.json,
which the Factory never opened.

"Not certified" means no evidence, never "known bad": the Store ships pilots
off the whole shelf. The point is that a product which labels a layer
*certified* must be able to point at something.
