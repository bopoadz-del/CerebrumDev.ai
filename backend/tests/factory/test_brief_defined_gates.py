"""A gate exists only if a brief can turn it on (AGENTS.md, GATES.md).

A round's failures are classified brief-defined vs factory-invented BEFORE
any writer dispatch. A failure on a check the brief never defined is the
gate's fault, not the product's: it goes advisory with the reason in the
ledger, and no writer round is spent on it.

The invented gate id below is made up for this file. It is in no floor, no
brief and no gate, which is exactly the point.
