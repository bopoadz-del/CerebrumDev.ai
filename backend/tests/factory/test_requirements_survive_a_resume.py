"""requirements.txt must declare the vendored blocks' packages, resume or not.

Live, a voice-agent platform: 23 vendored blocks, a requirements.txt of seven
packages and none of theirs. The clean Docker image had no numpy,
``vector_search`` could not load, one test went red and the image build failed
-- "acceptance.py in Docker 0/13". Reproduced exactly in a clean virtualenv
(1 failed / 87 passed), and 89 passed once the file declared what the vendored
source imports.

Cause: the CLONER kept the obligations in the runner's in-memory state, which
"dies with the process". The build timed out and resumed, so WRITER rendered
requirements.txt from None.
