"""The ceiling bump sees a CodeWhale writer's own progress.

Live 2026-10-08 (release cycle on 0e50fcc1, vineyard sess_e0208ddfe75642a5):
the writer reported STEP 7 and STEP 8 at 02:26, had 238 files on disk, and was
killed at 02:29 ("headless job exceeded 1800.0s" -- in fact the lifted 2700s
wall). The stage-2 inspect at 2700s decided ``await_cli`` with
``progressing=false``: a CodeWhale writer harvests its capabilities only when
its session ends, so caps_written stayed 0, and the one 2700->ceiling bump's
"visible work" test could not see the steps the writer was reporting.
