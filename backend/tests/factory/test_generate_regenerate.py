"""Generate + regenerate reproducibility.

What is actually guaranteed here changed once the factory coder started
writing GENERATE capabilities: an LLM does not emit the same bytes twice, so
"same blueprint -> same tree hash" can only ever hold for the part of the
product the coder did not write.

The old single test asserted whole-tree byte equality and therefore passed
only while the coder was doing nothing -- green on CI, which has no LLM key,
and red on any machine with one. That is the worst shape a test can have: it
reported the agent working as a failure. These two split the claim in half so
both halves stay true and both run without an API key.
