"""Anti-hollowness guard: the factory must vendor REAL block code.

Root cause of the hollow retail product (2026-07-26): the generator only
consulted CEREBRUM_BLOCKS_ROOT for a blocks checkout, so on any deploy without
a local path every referenced block was copied from the vendor MIRROR — echo
stubs whose block.py says "factory-vendor-mirror stub". The product looked
generated but did nothing.

These tests pin the contract that would have caught it:
- Given a real blocks_root carrying block_registry/<id>, the generated
  product's vendor/blocks/<id>/block.py is the REAL code, not the mirror stub.
- Given no blocks_root at all, the generator falls back to the mirror and says
  so honestly (the fallback is allowed, but it must be labeled, never silent).
- _blocks_root() prefers an explicit env path.
