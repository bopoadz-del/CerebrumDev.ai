"""FACTORY_GATE_COLLECT_ALL: one instrumented run, every finding, no halt.

Board P7: serial halt-close peels surfaced one finding per Approve run.
Collect-all suppresses gate halts so a single run logs the complete list,
then ends as COLLECT_ALL_REPORT — recorded, not ok, no sealed identity —
never a plausible SUCCESS.
