"""The Floor shows what the coding agent is doing, not just its last word.

Every STEP line the writer narrates already lands in the ledger as a NOTE,
but build-status only ever exposed ``last_event`` -- one sentence, replaced
every few minutes. From that an operator cannot tell a working agent from a
wedged one, which is the question the Floor exists to answer.
