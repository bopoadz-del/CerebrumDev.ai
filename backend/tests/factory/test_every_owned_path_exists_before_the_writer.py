"""Every Factory-owned path exists before a writer pass -- read off the one list.

Live, release cycle 8 (19fc746c):

* smoke B (account 0): "FAILED(WRITER, writer_contract, constraints.txt:
  created by the writer -- this file is Factory-owned ...)". constraints.txt
  was rendered only beside a requirements.txt, which does not exist before
  the first writer pass.
* fintech repeat pick (sess_3436e978c9e543b7): rounds 1/2 and 2/2 were the
  writer creating constraints.txt and TESTER's suites (tests/test_smoke.py,
  tests/test_routes.py, tests/test_domain_acceptance.py, ...), rendered only
  by TESTER, after the writer.

Same class as cycle 7's conftest.py / provenance.json (#717), which named two
files. Nothing here names a file: the test iterates the Factory-owned list.
Only what a build CARRIES rather than renders (the Store gate workflow, from
cerebrum-builds main with the checkpoint) and a suite the blueprint does not
call for are allowed to be absent.
