"""CD-LAUNCH-1 GATE 1: C-BRIEF CLI must ramp before the 1500s phase wall.

Measured sess_5782f2264e0e4ff4 Continue 2026-09-10: one indivisible
C-BRIEF CLI call ~1488s; WRITER ~1490s vs phase_wall_clock_s=1500.
``factory budget ramp`` was never emitted — ``_extend_wall`` is not
called on the CLI wait path. The CLI default ``wall_clock_s`` is already
7200 (#398 ceiling), so today's ``_extend_wall`` no-ops (new_wall <=
old_wall) and the 1500s phase box never lifts.

Ramp + salvage: while the CLI is alive and approaching
``phase_wall_clock_s``, call ``_extend_wall`` so the 7200s ceiling is
actually used. Do not "fix" by raising the initial phase wall.

reuse_accept is post-CLI keep-path (sess_5782f2264e0e4ff4 run3
estate_registry / storage miss). It cannot suppress this ramp. A
Continue with no ``factory budget ramp`` line either never approached
the phase box while CLI was in-flight, or ``_cli_in_flight`` was
false — that is not a reuse_accept defect.
