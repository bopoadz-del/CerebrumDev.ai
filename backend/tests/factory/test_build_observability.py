"""A long build must be observable, and a dead build must not look alive.

New-shape tests for two defects found while watching the FIRST live runner
build on production:

1. The ledger only records phase boundaries, so a WRITER pass of ~16 agent
   calls reported a frozen "2/5" for twenty-plus minutes. A customer -- and
   an operator debugging it -- could not distinguish work from a hang.
   Worse, nothing was in the logs either: no logging was configured, so
   every ``logging.getLogger("cerebrumdev...")`` line was dropped while
   uvicorn's access logs printed. The build was completely unobservable.

2. A build whose thread dies (worker restart, redeploy, OOM) leaves the
   ledger's last event as PHASE_STARTED forever, which read as "building"
   for eternity -- an infinite spinner for a build that no longer exists.

Progress is recorded as NOTE events, which must NOT disturb the verdict
readers: a progress line can never be mistaken for a gate result.
