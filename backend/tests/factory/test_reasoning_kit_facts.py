"""What the Floor model is told about the reasoning kit's questions.

This is the only place the domain owner's question sheet reaches the model that
runs a build. If it tells the model the wrong thing, the model asks the wrong
questions or, worse, presents a derived question as the domain's own and gets an
answer no rule can then use.

The assertions are about what the prompt CANNOT say:

  * never that an un-interviewed domain is in hand
  * never a derived question without saying it is derived
  * never a paraphrase of the owner's wording
  * never that an answer is held because a question was asked
