"""The Store Manager's books must answer honestly, including "I don't know".

New-shape tests for the read-only registrar. The dangerous failure here is not
a crash — it is a confident wrong answer. Two shapes specifically:

* Reporting a clone as "current" when the comparison was never possible. It is
  precisely the mirror-sourced clones, which carry stub code rather than real
  block logic, whose revision cannot be compared to a Store commit — so a
  cheerful "current" would bless exactly the ones that most need flagging.
* Missing that two platforms are running different code behind the same block
  name. Nothing in a delivered artifact reveals that; only the ledgers do.
