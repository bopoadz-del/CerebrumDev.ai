"""DISTRIBUTIONS must name every third-party import in the pinned Store.

Live, twice in one day, at the same stage:

    CLONER failed: vendored source imports 'bcrypt' and the factory has no
    PyPI distribution recorded for it; add it to
    block_obligations.DISTRIBUTIONS ...

``DISTRIBUTIONS`` is hand-kept "for every third-party import present in the
Store's block roster", and nothing checked that claim. Moving the Store pin
brought TWELVE import names the table had never seen; ``bcrypt`` was merely
the first one a build tripped over. Refusing is right -- guessing a PyPI name
ships a Dockerfile that fails at ``pip install`` -- but the refusal belongs
here, when the pin moves, not in a customer's build an hour later.

The fix the first time round swept one CLONER step across the registry and
missed this one entirely. So this file sweeps the whole vendorable surface.
