"""PRECONDITIONS BECOME STARTUP CODE (owner's ruling R1c, 2026-09-01).

The obligation used to reach the coder as prose in its prompt. On
residential-lettings three of four handlers did not obey it, and the one
that used the correct calling convention still answered::

    team: Team access denied

because nothing had ever created the team. A rule that must be re-obeyed in
every handler is a rule that will be missed in one, so the ensure step is
now generated code that runs once at boot, before any capability can be
called.

Two halves have to hold, and a test that proves only one is not worth its
line count:

  * the RIGHT obligations are emitted -- platform-scoped only. A per_record
    ensure step run at boot would have to invent the caller's data, which is
    F18, and would be a worse defect than the one being fixed.
  * the emitted module is JOINED to the product -- written by the WRITER,
    called by the lifespan after migrations and before the first request.

Each test names the mutation it kills, so a later reader can judge whether
the assertion still earns its place.
