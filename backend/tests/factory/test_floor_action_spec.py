"""The shared typed-action spec cannot drift from what the backend accepts.

Owner ruling 2026-10-05: the post-deploy smoke and the browser e2e share ONE
typed-action client, built from one committed file
(``frontend/src/api/floor_actions.json``) that the SPA's own ``FloorAction``
type is derived from too. This test is the drift gate: the file must equal
``floor_actions.action_spec()`` -- the actions ``parse_action`` accepts and
the value each one takes. Regenerate with:

    cd backend && python -c "import json; from app.factory.floor_actions import action_spec; \
open('../frontend/src/api/floor_actions.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8', newline='\\n')\
.write(json.dumps(action_spec(), indent=2) + '\\n')"
