"""The Floor shows what the writer is doing, for the whole pass.

Owner, seven minutes into a live build: "i dont see any updates for the
writer". Two separate causes, both measured on live runs:

1. The agent's first stretch -- reading the brief and the cloned blocks --
   writes no STEP line and no file for ~10 minutes (STEP 1 landed at 9m16s
   on one build and 10m01s on the next). The factory said nothing either.
2. When the agent does write its progress log it writes a burst, and the
   relay's 3s throttle DISCARDED everything after the first line: one live
   log read "STEP 1" and then "STEP 21".

# -- the model-call NOTE is CLOSED when the CLI session ends -------------------

# Live, 2026-09-28: the Floor declared "coder LLM timed out after 2595s
# (deadline 1800s)" on a build whose writer session had already finished and
# whose run was still working. The codewhale path OPENED the model-call NOTE
# ("codewhale writer CLI started") and never emitted the
# "FACTORY_CODE_CLI session finished" close that build_status waits for --
# only the C-BRIEF dispatch layer (coder_session) ever emitted it. So on
# EVERY codewhale build, 1800s of wall clock after the CLI started --
# regardless of what the run was doing by then -- _model_call_overdue flipped
# the status to failed and the Floor showed CODING AGENT STOPPED over a live
# run.
