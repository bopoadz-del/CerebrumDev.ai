"""The Factory reads the Store's inventory instead of a copy of it.

What the Factory offered was a hand-written file: app/factory/shelves/
factory_blocks.json, 25 blocks with their kit assignments. The Store holds
136 blocks (every block_registry/<id>/block.json carries id, version and
trust_tier) and shelves 18 kits marked available. So the chat told a finance
customer there was no ready kit while block_store/kits/finance_ops sat there
marked available, carrying a chart-of-accounts governance block -- and the
coding agent wrote a five-entry chart of accounts from scratch.

Two questions were sharing one file. What the Store HOLDS is now read from
the Store. What the Factory has CLEARED to attach stays the Factory's own
statement, because nothing in the Store says which blocks are cleared for a
customer build -- all 136 are trust_tier "platform".
