"""Clone-and-test standard: every generated pilot is self-verifying.

A client clones the repo, runs scripts/release_gate.py, and watches the
pilot prove itself. These tests lock the TEMPLATE generator to that
contract; it is no longer the production default (see
``test_production_uses_the_runner.py``) but remains the documented revert
path, so its contract still has to hold. The runner artifact's equivalent
promise is asserted in the cutover tests.
