"""The three contract gates must be shown to say NO.

Their parts are tested elsewhere. The composites were not, and a composite
that forgets to propagate a failing part is exactly the defect the roster
change was made to prevent: gate_writer_contract exists because compilation
alone passed a route that discarded its handler's result.

scripts/audit_gates.py fails CI without these, so the absence cannot recur
quietly.
