"""The WRITER gate's schema-accept probe posts what TESTER posts.

Live 2026-10-07 (9de69276 vineyard repro): the build stopped on
"no capability accepted its own schema" (SAME_FAILURE_TWICE). The probe built
its payloads from a sampler of its own (``_value``/``_payload``) while TESTER
posted the Factory spec sample through the shared builder (payload_helpers,
over the product's live declared models). Two samplers, two verdicts -- and
the rework item said only "baseline POST returned HTTP 404", nothing the
writer could converge on. One builder now; the product's own refusal text
travels with every miss.
