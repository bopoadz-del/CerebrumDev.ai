"""THE VERDICT LINE MUST NOT OVERCLAIM (owner's ruling 1, 2026-09-01).

FINDING 3: the factory reported "all phase gates passed" while the code-phase
gate runs ``pytest -m "not pilot"`` -- and ``@pytest.mark.pilot`` is the
marker on the only tests that exercise a business action. The sentence was
literally "everything except the tests that check the product works passed".
residential-lettings (sess_6400b6c273414352) built, shipped a 216-file zip,
booted, served seventeen routes, and could not persist one record, with every
gate green.

The fix is a third gate and an honest sentence. Both are tested here:

* PRODUCT boots the product, runs the pilot-marked suite against it, and
  round-trips one record per capability (R1e: POST creates, GET returns it).
* The verdict names THREE gates, each with its scope, and a gate that did not
  run says NOT RUN rather than being folded into a pass.

Each test names the mutation it kills.
