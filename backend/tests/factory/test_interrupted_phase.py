"""A killed phase must not leave a workspace that looks finished.

New-shape tests for the defect a killed live build exposed. The process died
during a WRITER rework round and left:

    models.py, store.py   from the killed pass   (table `defect`)
    routes.py, main.py    from an earlier pass   (store.save("field_defect"))

The platform booted and then answered
``sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: field_defect``. The agent picks
different entity names on each call, so two partial passes do not compose.

Resume made it worse rather than catching it: WRITER's last *terminal* event
was GATE_PASSED from the previous round, so completed_roles() called it done
and resume_point() returned TESTER — which would test a torn app/. The
existing resume test only ever kills *between* phases, so it could not see
this.

Two guarantees are asserted here:
  * the destination is never touched until a pass completes, so a hard kill
    leaves the previous complete attempt;
  * a role whose last event is PHASE_STARTED is running, not complete.
