"""Every clone must record where it came from and at what revision.

New-shape tests for the gap that blocked the Store registrar. Clones were
recorded as ``source_commit: "unpinned"`` -- see any older ledger,
``cloned analytics@unpinned`` -- because run_cloner wrote no revision into
blocks.lock.json.

That makes staleness unanswerable, and unrecoverably so: once a platform
ships, the commit a block came from cannot be reconstructed, because the
vendored files look identical whether they are current or a year behind. The
registrar's whole question -- "which platform took which block, and is it
stale against store head" -- depends on this being captured at build time.
