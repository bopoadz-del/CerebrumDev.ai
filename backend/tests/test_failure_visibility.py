"""Tests that failures are actually visible to the platform.

The defects these guard against all shared one shape: the system was broken and
said it was fine. A health endpoint that reports "degraded" with a 200, and a
migration that fails into a running service, are both invisible to Render --
which reads exit codes and status codes, not JSON bodies.

So these assert on the machine-readable signal, not the human-readable one.
