"""A gate that cannot block is not a gate.

This repository has shipped that defect four separate times: lotdesk_gate
tested but wired to nothing, grounding's ``strict`` branch unreachable
because no caller passed it, ``store_write_exists`` a literal False, and a
generated release_gate invoked by no product. Each was found by hand, months
apart. This audit finds the next one.

Three properties, checked statically over app/factory/build/:

  1. REACHABLE -- every gate_* function is the roster or is called,
     transitively, by something in it. A gate nothing calls is dead code
     wearing a gate's name.
  2. CONSUMED  -- the roster itself is read by a non-test module. Because
     reachability is measured FROM the roster, an unconsumed roster would
     make every gate in the tree look reachable while none could fire.
  3. REFUSED   -- some test asserts it says NO. A test that only proves a
     gate passes on good input is compatible with a gate that passes on
     everything, which is the failure mode being guarded against.

Coverage propagates DOWN the call graph: a refusal test against a composite
covers the parts it delegates to. That is deliberate -- exercising the
composite is the better test, because it also proves the composite
propagates its parts' verdicts rather than swallowing them. The limitation
is real and worth naming: this cannot tell WHICH part a composite's refusal
test tripped, so a composite tested only on its first check will still mark
its later parts covered. Guard that with a test asserting the composite does
not stop at its first part (see test_contract_gates_refuse.py).

Exit 1 on any unregistered finding; register in KNOWN_GATE_GAPS.md.
