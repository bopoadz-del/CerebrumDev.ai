"""The release cycle: after a deploy, smoke A and the repro builds run AT THE
SAME TIME, each on its own verified account; smoke B runs once all of them are
done; one report says what shipped.

Owner's standing rules (2026-10-08): repro builds run in parallel with smoke A
on separate accounts; the smoke keeps its reserved build slot; slots queue,
never fail. The whole cycle runs on GitHub Actions (post-deploy-smoke.yml),
never as a local background process -- a laptop's memory must never decide
whether a cycle finishes. On 2026-10-07 every cycle ran the second repro AFTER
smoke A, by hand, from a local watcher that kept expiring.

One commit per cycle. ``live-sha`` resolves the commit the cycle is about
(the deployed sha, or whatever /version serves now) and fails closed unless
live /version IS that commit; the report re-reads /version and fails the cycle
if it moved.

Accounts. The smoke gate issues a roster of verified principals
(``/v1/auth/smoke-login`` with ``principals``). Index 0 is the smoke's own --
the only account whose builds may use the worker's reserved slot. The repros
take indices 1..K, one each. Fewer accounts than runs FAILS CLOSED: two builds
on one account share its tenant slot and would run one after the other while
the report claimed a parallel cycle.

Briefs are data (``scripts/release_cycle.json``); this file knows none of them.

What a cycle builds (owner ruling, 2026-10-08). The ANCHORS -- the regression
pair in ``release_cycle.json``, whose certified exports make a flip there a
regression -- plus ROTATION picks from the pool in ``backend/tests/repro_pool``
(at least eight blueprints across verticals, each with its own country,
currency and build level). Cycle ``k`` builds ``pool[(p*k + i) mod n]`` for the
pool's ``p`` picks, so with eight blueprints and two picks each comes round
every four cycles. Nothing here knows any blueprint; nothing is random. ``k``
advances only past a cycle that PASSED: the newest completed cycle's own
uploaded report decides -- passed, ``k+1``; failed, the same ``k``, so the
"one more cycle" after a fix re-runs the picks that failed; no report with a
rotation yet, ``0``. The record is GitHub's (the previous runs of this
workflow and their report artifacts), read with the run's own token; nothing
is stored anywhere, and an unreadable report fails closed. Release = every
anchor AND every pick exports certified, and smoke A and smoke B pass, on one
commit.
