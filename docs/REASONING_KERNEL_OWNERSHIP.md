**Correct. The Reasoning Kernel belongs entirely in `CerebrumDev.ai`, not in the Store.** I placed that ownership incorrectly.

## Final architecture

```text
CerebrumDev.ai
= The brain

Cerebrum-Blocks
= The capability warehouse

Cerebrum-Steward
= Authority, identity and governance

Product repository
= The generated working application
```

### `CerebrumDev.ai` owns the real Reasoning Kernel

It must contain:

* Domain Scout
* Domain Intelligence Compiler
* Ontology engine
* Formula registry and execution coordination
* Rule engine
* Decision-table engine
* Workflow/state-machine engine
* Approval-matrix engine
* Reasoning planner
* Intent-to-action planning
* Dependency and missing-input detection
* Conflict detection
* Assumption management
* Refusal engine
* Evidence requirements
* Authority resolution
* Verification-oracle runner
* Domain-pack validation and certification
* Platform generation
* Product assembly

This is the system that understands:

```text
What does the user want?
What domain applies?
Which rules apply?
Which formulas must run?
Which workflow state are we in?
What evidence is required?
Who may perform the action?
Who must approve it?
What must be refused?
Which Store blocks should execute?
```

That is clearly **CerebrumDev.ai**.

## `Cerebrum-Blocks` does not reason globally

The Store should hold the versioned executable capabilities that Dev.ai selects and coordinates:

* Finance calculations
* Construction calculations
* Insurance commission blocks
* Retail inventory blocks
* Formula executor
* Document parsers
* Reconciliation blocks
* Export blocks
* RAG components
* Connectors
* Certified domain kits
* Typed input/output contracts
* Tests and manifests

The Store answers:

```text
What certified capability can perform this operation?
```

It should not decide the complete business plan, workflow, authority or approval route.

## `Cerebrum-Steward` remains the authority layer

Steward provides:

* Identity
* Tenant and project scope
* Roles and permissions
* Trusted source authority
* Policy ownership
* Approval records
* Segregation of duties
* Audit authority
* Knowledge authority
* Governance controls

Dev.ai asks Steward:

```text
Is this user allowed?
Is this source authoritative?
Who must approve?
Has the exact payload been approved?
```

## Correct execution model

```text
User request
      ↓
CerebrumDev.ai Reasoning Kernel
      ↓
Understand intent and domain
      ↓
Load Domain Constitution
      ↓
Apply rules, formulas and workflow logic
      ↓
Check authority with Cerebrum-Steward
      ↓
Select certified Cerebrum-Blocks
      ↓
Produce an execution plan
      ↓
Human approval where required
      ↓
Product executes the selected blocks
      ↓
Verify, explain and record evidence
```

## Correct repository ownership

```text
bopoadz-del/CerebrumDev.ai
└── reasoning_kernel/
    ├── scout/
    ├── compiler/
    ├── ontology/
    ├── formulas/
    ├── rules/
    ├── decisions/
    ├── workflows/
    ├── approvals/
    ├── planner/
    ├── authority/
    ├── verification/
    ├── certification/
    └── generator/
```

```text
bopoadz-del/Cerebrum-Blocks
└── domain_kits/
    ├── construction_ops/
    ├── retail_ops/
    ├── insurance_ops/
    ├── finance_ops/
    └── investment_analysis/
```

Each Domain Kit may contain formula definitions, rules and workflow descriptions as **domain content**, but the engine that interprets, validates, plans and orchestrates them stays in `CerebrumDev.ai`.

## The corrected equation

```text
CerebrumDev.ai Reasoning Kernel
+ Cerebrum Universal Platform Kernel
+ Certified Store Domain Kit
+ Steward authority
+ Client configuration
= Generated intelligent platform
```

So the final promotion sequence is:

1. Scout all existing products.
2. Extract their reusable reasoning patterns.
3. Build the **Reasoning Kernel inside `CerebrumDev.ai`**.
4. Publish certified executable domain capabilities into `Cerebrum-Blocks`.
5. Use Steward for authority and governance.
6. Generate a neutral proof platform.
7. Then generate future platforms rapidly.

**The brain stays in CerebrumDev.ai. The Store supplies the tools the brain chooses.**
