# Terms of Service

> **DRAFT — NOT YET IN FORCE. REQUIRES REVIEW BY A QUALIFIED LAWYER BEFORE
> PUBLICATION.**
>
> This draft was written to match what the platform actually does, so that a
> lawyer reviews accurate facts rather than boilerplate. Every item marked
> `[[NEEDS INPUT]]` requires a decision only the operator or their counsel can
> make. Do not publish this document, or link to it from the product, until
> those are resolved and the text has been reviewed.

**Effective date:** `[[NEEDS INPUT: date of publication]]`
**Provider:** `[[NEEDS INPUT: registered legal entity name, company number, registered address]]`
**Contact:** `[[NEEDS INPUT: support/legal email address]]`

## 1. What this service is

Cerebrum ("the Service") is a hosted platform that generates software
prototypes and related artefacts from descriptions you provide. You give the
Service a brief; it produces a blueprint, generates a working prototype, and
lets you download that prototype as an archive.

The Service is provided on an "as available" basis and is under active
development. Parts of it are explicitly incomplete; those parts are listed in
the product's `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS` document, which forms part of these terms by
reference.

## 2. Accounts

You must register an account to use the Service. You must provide a valid
email address, you are responsible for the security of your password and API
keys, and you are responsible for all activity under your account. You must be
at least `[[NEEDS INPUT: minimum age — 16 under GDPR, 18 if you prefer]]` years
old and legally able to enter a contract.

One person or organisation may not create multiple accounts in order to
circumvent the free-trial limits in section 3. We may suspend accounts we
reasonably believe are doing so.

## 3. Free trial and paid subscriptions

Free accounts are subject to server-enforced quotas. As at the effective date
these are:

| Limit | Allowance | Period |
|---|---|---|
| Product generations | 3 | Lifetime of the trial account |
| Chat messages | 100 | Per day |
| Prototype exports | 5 | Lifetime of the trial account |

These figures are configurable and may change. The limits in force at any time
are those enforced by the Service. Exceeding a limit returns an error and an
invitation to subscribe; it does not incur a charge.

Paid subscriptions are billed through Stripe. `[[NEEDS INPUT: subscription
price, billing period, renewal terms, cancellation terms, and refund policy —
note that many jurisdictions, including the EU and UK, grant consumers a
statutory cooling-off right that your refund policy must respect]]`

## 4. Your content and your generated output

You retain ownership of the material you submit ("Your Content") and of the
prototypes and artefacts the Service generates for you ("Your Output"). We
claim no ownership of either.

You grant us a limited licence to process Your Content solely to operate the
Service and produce Your Output — including transmitting it to the third-party
model providers listed in the Privacy Policy. `[[NEEDS INPUT: confirm you do
NOT want a broader licence, e.g. to use customer content to improve the
Service. The current draft says you do not. If you ever want to train on
customer content you must say so here explicitly and offer an opt-out.]]`

You are responsible for ensuring you have the right to submit Your Content and
that doing so does not infringe anyone else's rights or applicable law.

## 5. AI-generated output — important

**The Service produces output using large language models. That output may be
incorrect, insecure, non-functional, or unsuitable for your purpose, and it may
resemble other material.**

You must review, test and validate any generated code or advice before relying
on it, and you are solely responsible for anything you deploy or act upon. The
Service is a development aid, not a substitute for professional judgement,
security review, or independent verification.

The Service does not attempt certain categories of question at all — including
medication dosing, structural sign-off, legal filing strategy, and live
emergencies — and will refuse them. That refusal is a safety feature. Do not
attempt to work around it, and never use the Service for any purpose where a
wrong answer could cause injury, or legal or financial harm.

## 6. Acceptable use

You may not use the Service to: break any law; infringe intellectual property;
generate malware, spam, or material designed to deceive; attempt to access
another user's data or account; probe, scan, overload, or circumvent the
Service's limits or security controls; resell access without our written
agreement; or submit personal data of others without a lawful basis.

We may suspend or terminate access for breach of this section, and we may do so
immediately where there is a risk to the Service or its users.

## 7. Availability, changes and termination

We do not guarantee any level of uptime and may modify, suspend, or discontinue
any part of the Service. We will make reasonable efforts to give notice of
material adverse changes. `[[NEEDS INPUT: whether you want to commit to any
notice period or SLA for paid subscribers — recommended, and expected by
business customers]]`

You may close your account at any time. On closure we will delete or anonymise
your data as described in the Privacy Policy. We may terminate an account for
breach of these terms, or for any reason on reasonable notice.

## 8. Disclaimers and limitation of liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Service is provided "as is" and
"as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, and
non-infringement.

`[[NEEDS INPUT: liability cap and exclusions. This clause is the single most
important one for the provider and must be drafted by a lawyer for the chosen
governing law. Consumer-protection law limits how far liability can be
excluded, and those limits differ sharply between the UAE, the EU, the UK and
the US. Do not ship a generic cap.]]`

Nothing in these terms excludes liability that cannot lawfully be excluded,
including for death or personal injury caused by negligence, or for fraud.

## 9. Changes to these terms

We may update these terms. Material changes will be notified to the email
address on your account and will take effect `[[NEEDS INPUT: notice period]]`
after notification. Continuing to use the Service after that constitutes
acceptance.

## 10. Governing law and disputes

`[[NEEDS INPUT: governing law and forum. This depends on where the legal
entity is registered and where your customers are. If the entity is in the UAE
and you intend to sell into the EU/UK, note that consumer-protection rules of
the customer's own country may still apply regardless of what this clause
says.]]`

### Open questions for counsel

1. The legal entity, its jurisdiction, and the governing-law clause.
2. The liability cap, and whether the customer set is consumer, business, or both — this changes what may lawfully be excluded.
3. Whether GDPR/UK GDPR applies (any EU/UK users at all), which drives the Privacy Policy's legal bases, the data-processing terms, and whether a representative must be appointed.
4. Refund and cancellation terms, including statutory cooling-off rights.
5. Whether an indemnity from the customer is wanted for their misuse of generated output.
6. Whether the AI-output disclaimer in section 5 is sufficient in the target jurisdiction, particularly where generated code is deployed into production by customers.
