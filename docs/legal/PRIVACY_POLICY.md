## 1. What we collect

**Account data.** Your email address, a salted PBKDF2 hash of your password
(we never store the password itself), whether your email is verified, and the
date your account was created.

**Authentication data.** Hashed login tokens and hashed API keys. Raw tokens
are shown to you once and are not recoverable from our records.

**Usage data.** Counters recording how many generations, chat messages and
exports you have used, for enforcing trial limits and billing.

**Your Content.** Anything you submit — briefs, chat messages, uploaded
documents — and the prototypes and artefacts the Service generates from it.

**Technical data.** Server logs and error reports generated when you use the
Service, which may include IP address, request paths, timestamps and diagnostic
context.

**Payment data.** Handled by Stripe. `[[NEEDS INPUT: confirm the platform never
stores card details itself — the code uses Stripe Checkout, which means card
data goes directly to Stripe and does not touch our servers. State this
explicitly once confirmed.]]`

## 2. Third parties who process your data

Using the Service necessarily sends data to the following processors. This list
is derived from the production code.

| Processor | What it receives | Purpose | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| Render | Everything hosted — the application, database and disks | Hosting | Oregon, USA |
| Moonshot AI (Kimi) | **Your Content** — briefs, chat messages, and document text sent for inference | Generating output | `[[NEEDS INPUT: confirm region and obtain their DPA]]` |
| Stripe | Email, billing identifiers, payment details | Subscriptions | Global |
| Sentry | Error reports, which may incidentally include request context | Error tracking | `[[NEEDS INPUT: confirm region]]` |

**The most important disclosure on this page: to generate output, the content
you submit is transmitted to a third-party AI model provider outside our
infrastructure.** If you submit confidential or personal information belonging
to someone else, it leaves our systems. Do not submit anything you are not
permitted to share with a third-party processor.

`[[NEEDS INPUT: a signed data-processing agreement is required with each
processor above before onboarding EU/UK users. Moonshot AI is the one to check
first — confirm what they do with submitted content, in particular whether they
retain it or train on it, and whether that can be disabled. If they train on
submitted content by default, that must be stated here in plain language, and
it may be commercially unacceptable to business customers.]]`

## 3. Why we process it, and on what basis

| Purpose | Data used | `[[NEEDS INPUT: lawful basis if GDPR applies]]` |
|---|---|---|
| Providing the Service | Account, Your Content | Performance of a contract |
| Enforcing trial limits and preventing abuse | Usage counters, technical data | Legitimate interests |
| Billing | Account, payment data | Performance of a contract |
| Security, debugging, keeping the Service working | Technical data, error reports | Legitimate interests |
| Service-related email | Account data | Performance of a contract |

We do **not** sell your data, and we do not use Your Content to train our own
models. `[[NEEDS INPUT: this statement is only true end-to-end if the upstream
model provider also does not train on submitted content — verify before
publishing, because publishing it while untrue would be a misrepresentation.]]`

## 4. How long we keep it

`[[NEEDS INPUT: retention periods. Nothing in the current code deletes anything
automatically, which means the honest answer today is "indefinitely, until you
ask us to delete it". That is a weak position under GDPR and should be replaced
with defined periods — a common shape is: account data for the life of the
account plus 30 days; Your Content until you delete it or close your account;
logs and error reports 30-90 days; billing records for the statutory period,
typically 6-7 years.]]`

## 5. Your rights

Depending on where you live you may have the right to access, correct, delete,
export, or restrict processing of your personal data, to object to processing
based on legitimate interests, and to complain to a supervisory authority.

To exercise any of these, contact `[[NEEDS INPUT: privacy contact]]`. We will
respond within `[[NEEDS INPUT: 30 days is the GDPR default]]`.

`[[NEEDS INPUT: there is currently no self-service account-deletion or
data-export path in the product. Until one exists these requests must be
handled manually, and someone has to own that inbox. Building self-service
deletion and export is recommended before opening public registration.]]`

## 6. Security

Passwords are stored as salted PBKDF2 hashes. Login tokens and API keys are
stored hashed. Traffic is served over HTTPS. Access to the production
environment is limited to the operator.

`[[NEEDS INPUT: describe the breach-notification process. GDPR requires
notifying the supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of a
personal-data breach. There is currently no documented incident process —
one should exist before launch.]]`

## 7. Cookies and local storage

The Service stores your login token in your browser's local storage so you stay
signed in. `[[NEEDS INPUT: confirm whether any analytics or advertising cookies
are used — none were found in the code. If none, say so plainly; if you add
analytics later, a cookie banner is likely required in the EU/UK.]]`

## 8. Children

The Service is not intended for children under
`[[NEEDS INPUT: age, matching the Terms]]` and we do not knowingly collect
their data.

## 9. International transfers

Your data is processed in the United States and potentially elsewhere by the
processors listed in section 2. `[[NEEDS INPUT: if EU/UK users are in scope,
identify the transfer mechanism — Standard Contractual Clauses, adequacy, or
otherwise — for each processor.]]`

## 10. Changes

We will post changes here and, where material, notify you by email.

### Engineering work this policy implies

These are product gaps this document exposes, listed so they are not lost:

1. **Self-service data export and account deletion.** Neither exists today.
2. **Defined retention, and a job that enforces it.** Nothing expires now.
3. **A monitored privacy inbox** for data-subject requests.
4. **Signed DPAs** with Render, Moonshot AI, Stripe and Sentry.
5. **A documented breach-notification process** meeting the 72-hour rule.
6. **Confirmation of what Moonshot AI does with submitted content** — this is
   the single highest-impact unknown on this page.
