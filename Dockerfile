# postgresql-client is 15 and pg_dump then exits 1 (version mismatch).
# Install the PGDG 18 client so nightly dumps match the server.
# Write the PGDG ASCII key and point apt signed-by at it. Slim images often
# omit the gpg binary even when gnupg is listed, which failed CI in ~20s.
# SQLAlchemy fallback in app.core.backup still covers a mismatch if apt pins drift.
